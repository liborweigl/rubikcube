This is the initial iteration, with the primary goal being to produce the desired outcome and demonstrate my capability to complete the task.
During the design and development phase, one of the following criteria was to maintain simplicity, ensuring that I could have a functional solution ready within a reasonable timeframe.
Please inform me if you have any questions or if there are any changes I should make.

Add UnitTest
Use Dependency injection
Refactor code (Use more optimal structure to store 3d matrix)
